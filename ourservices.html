                    The risk assessment process in validation involves recognizing potential risks, such as equipment malfunctions or software errors, and documenting them. Subsequently, risks are analyzed for their likelihood and severity, providing insights into their impact on the validation process and the end product. Prioritizing risks based on significance helps focus resources on addressing the most critical issues first. Strategies for risk mitigation, including process modifications or additional controls, are then developed. The entire process, including risk identification, analysis, prioritization, and mitigation strategies, is meticulously documented for regulatory compliance and audit purposes.
